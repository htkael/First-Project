# First-Project
The first project for my portfolio.
I have been doing the Odin project for about a week now. I have come to the first project in this course. I expect it to be very challenging. But I am excited to learn. Whenever I step back and take a break, I will update this file to reflect on the changes and challenges I overcame.

First Session: Made a lot of progress to realize that I think I organized the flexbox wrong, I am choosing to completely restart at this point.

Second Session: Ran into even more problems. I tried basically changing the layout into columns from rows, but was unable to get it correct for a while. Take a break.

Third Session: I decided to restart again. This was a good choice. I reworked my code starting from the simplest block and going up. I made sure to get each element working first then I would move on. This proved to be the best method. I finished in just 3.5 hours. Let's go!
